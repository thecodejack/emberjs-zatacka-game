**Will soon share code
-----------------------

Inspired from backbone app of avinash's <a href="https://github.com/hardfire/Zatacka">Zatacka</a>

Some Points
-----------
The game has taken many advantages of emberJS like property bindings and some EmberJS's native functions. This really made the application look smaller in terms of LOC over Backbone App.
