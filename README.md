The game has been started to test my EmberJS learning and imporved on the way. Inspired from backbone app of avinash's <a href="https://github.com/hardfire/Zatacka">Zatacka</a>

Some Points
-----------
The game has taken many advantages of emberJS like property bindings and some EmberJS's native functions. This really made the application look smaller in terms of LOC over Backbone App. But that may have affected the rendering in the game which i will work and correct it soon.

ToDos
-----
1) Working on using Socket.io to make game playable online.
2) Rendering Issues.
